// The load event fires at the end of the document loading process. 
// At this point, all of the objects in the document are in the DOM, 
// and all the images, scripts, links and sub-frames have finished loading.

// An arrow function expression has a shorter syntax than a function expression 
// and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. 
// These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions, 
// and they cannot be used as constructors.
